# subscriptioForm-with-phpmailer
I made simple and basic project for testing phpmailer in my subscription form and it was successfully work.


First you should turn on your GMAIL Account Two-steps verification then you should create app password from your google account. I emphasize which part of the code you are going to paste app pasword and your email so no worries.

(Do not forget to install and open apache mode on XAMPP Control Panel.)
